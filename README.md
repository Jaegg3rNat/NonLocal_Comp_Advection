# NonLocal_Comp_Advection


This Repository was create to contain the main codes used in the development of numerical simulations 

The Main Code is the Run_Integration_Flow.py 
- Is used to perform the pseudospectral integration of the Non-Local logistic model with Advection.

  The standard running consists in run the simulation until it reaches the equilibrium.
  The only output is the the final density distribution in 2-dimensions.
  The time array
  The complete array of mean density for each time step dt.
